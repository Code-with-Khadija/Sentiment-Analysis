# Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
Understanding public sentiment is crucial for businesses, researchers, and social media analysts. Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion mining, leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine the emotional tone behind textual data. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. By analyzing textual data, businesses can gain insights into customer opinions, social media trends, and product feedback.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans and tokenizes textual data.
- **Feature Extraction:** Uses TF-IDF and word embeddings.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Deep Learning:** Incorporates LSTMs for advanced sentiment prediction.
- **Visualization:** Displays sentiment trends through graphs and word clouds.
- **Real-time Analysis:** Can be integrated into live applications for real-time sentiment monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)

## Dataset
The dataset contains labeled textual data categorized into three sentiment classes:
- **Positive:** Indicates favorable sentiment.
- **Negative:** Represents unfavorable sentiment.
- **Neutral:** Shows impartial opinions.

Dataset File: `sentiment.csv`

## Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were applied to clean and normalize the dataset:
1. **Removing Stopwords**: Eliminates common words that do not contribute to sentiment.
2. **Tokenization**: Splits text into individual words.
3. **Lemmatization**: Converts words to their base forms.
4. **Vectorization**: Converts text into numerical representations using TF-IDF.

## Model Selection
Multiple machine learning models were trained and compared:
- **Naïve Bayes:** Effective for text classification problems.
- **Logistic Regression:** Provides a probabilistic approach to classification.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Works well for high-dimensional data.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** A deep learning model that captures sequential dependencies in text.

## Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

## Implementation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Load and run `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` to train and evaluate models.

## Results
- **Naïve Bayes:** Achieved an accuracy of ~85%.
- **Logistic Regression:** Performed well with an accuracy of ~88%.
- **SVM:** Showed the best performance with an accuracy of ~90%.
- **LSTM:** Achieved an even higher accuracy (~92%) with proper hyperparameter tuning.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement real-time sentiment analysis using Twitter API.
- Enhance deep learning models with transformer-based architectures (BERT, GPT, etc.).
- Deploy as a web application using Flask or FastAPI.
